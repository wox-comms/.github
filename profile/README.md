# üôã‚Äç What is WOX
WOX is a chat application with extreme encryption and a modern design designed by a young team. Unlike other chat applications, it is possible to send messages directly between phones / machines, which not only raises the call latency to an unprecedented level, but also makes communication much more secure, as there is no so-called ‚Äúserver‚Äù between devices.

# :closed_lock_with_key: Custom encryption
You can enter custom encryption passwords for each conversation. This password is discussed and set live between the parties. Thus, if a hacker tries to break into one of the groups, it would take him several years, as each group has different passwords for encryption. (Obviously, the basic encryptions found in other services, such as Messeneger, are also here)

# :sound: Audio effects

In the chat, you can vary the volume of each person in the call during a call, and use EQ or compressor effects. (The team plans to be able to use VST add-ons as an effect by composers in later versions)

# üßô Other features
In the program we have the possibility to use our phone's camera as a webcam for a machine call.

Login is required to use 2-Step Verification, making it impossible for people to try to crack your password.

Direct connection can be enabled or disabled per friend (whitelist and blacklist are possible)
